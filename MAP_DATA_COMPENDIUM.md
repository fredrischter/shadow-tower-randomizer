## Structure Notes

### Table Boundaries

The exact boundaries of the 6 tables need verification. Current analysis uses heuristic division.

To find exact boundaries, look for:
1. Size headers (16-bit or 32-bit integers at table start)
2. Padding regions (sequences of 0x00 or 0xFF)
3. Alignment boundaries (256-byte, 512-byte aligned)
4. Pattern changes (different data structure formats)

### Common Map Data Table Types

Typical map data structures in PSX games include:
1. **Tile/Cell Data** - Grid layout, floor/wall types, heights
2. **Object Placement** - Doors, items, enemies, scenery positions
3. **Collision Data** - Walkable regions, wall boundaries
4. **Lighting/Visual** - Fog, ambient color, lighting zones
5. **Navigation/AI** - Pathfinding nodes, trigger zones
6. **Metadata** - Map name, area transitions, script references

### Next Steps

To properly parse these tables:
1. Identify exact table boundaries (may need SIZED_MIX_PARTS data)
2. Determine entry size for each table
3. Map fields to game data (coordinates, IDs, flags, etc.)
4. Cross-reference with existing map.json and data_model.js
5. Update data_model.js with proper parsing structures
