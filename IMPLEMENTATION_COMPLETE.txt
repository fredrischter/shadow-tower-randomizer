║               ISSUE #31: CREATURE SPEED FIX - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE        ║
╚══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
"this changed exe has absolutely no change in creature speed, 
 try more try other places aggressively"

ROOT CAUSE:
✗ Speed modification code was COMMENTED OUT (randomize.js lines 534-583)
✗ Code existed but NEVER EXECUTED
✗ Result: No creature speed changes applied

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:

✅ 4 AGGRESSIVE APPROACHES (all run simultaneously):

   1. Creature.spd field (offset 0x25)
   2. EntityStateData.movementSpeed (offset 0x08)
   3. EntityStateData.actionSpeedTimer (offset 0x03)
   4. Experimental bytes (8 additional unknown bytes)

   TOTAL: 11 bytes modified per creature

CODE CHANGES:
- randomize.js (lines 532-604): Speed modification logic
  * Uncommented and reorganized
  * Made standalone (runs when creatureSpeedMultiplier is set)
  * Added aggressive experimental byte modifications
  * Comprehensive logging for debugging

FILES CREATED:
✓ test_speed_code.js - Code validation
✓ test_speed_fix.js - Runtime testing
✓ ISSUE_31_SUMMARY.md - Quick reference guide
✓ CREATURE_SPEED_FIX_ISSUE_31.md - Technical documentation
✓ BEFORE_AFTER_CREATURE_SPEED.md - Visual comparison
✓ show_speed_byte_map.js - Byte modification map

TESTING:
✓ Syntax validation: PASSED
✓ Code structure validation: PASSED
✓ All approaches present: PASSED
✓ Test presets available: PASSED

NEXT STEPS (requires user with ISO):
1. Build test ISO: npm run mod "st.bin" "./params/fast-creatures.json"
2. Test in PSX emulator
3. Report which bytes affect speed
4. Remove ineffective modifications based on findings

STATUS: IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅
        AWAITING IN-GAME VALIDATION ⏳

Implementation Date: December 19, 2025
